# My Android Photo Feed App (Internship Assignment)
This Android application is part of an internship application and showcases my proficiency in Android development using Kotlin and XML. The app features an onboarding screen with skip and ready buttons, leading users to the home screen. The home screen offers two main buttons - "Feeds" and "Upload."

## Features
*Feeds*: Tapping this button displays a feed of 10 images fetched from a public API, presented in a recycler view. The images refresh each time the feed is viewed.

*Upload*: This button allows users to choose an image from their gallery (Please note that the upload functionality has not been implemented yet).
